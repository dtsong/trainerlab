## The Name

**Trainer** — Universal Pokemon terminology. Every player is a trainer. Parents have trainers. Coaches train trainers. It's inclusive.

**Lab** — Where research happens. Experimentation. Discovery. Data-driven decisions. Not just consuming content — doing the work.

**Together:** A research lab for trainers. Where you come to do the homework that gives you an edge.

## Positioning Statement

**For** competitive Pokemon TCG players, coaches, content creators, and parents

**Who** want to make data-driven decisions about deck building, format preparation, and the hobby

**TrainerLab is** a competitive intelligence platform

**That** aggregates tournament data, translates Japanese format insights, and provides research tools

**Unlike** scattered resources and manual research

**We** give you a unified lab where all the homework is done — so you can focus on playing, coaching, creating, or supporting.

## Audience-Specific Value Props

### For Competitors

> "TrainerLab is where I do my tournament prep. Japanese meta data shows me what's coming, inclusion rates tell me what the best players are running, and the deck builder helps me optimize my list."

### For Coaches

> "TrainerLab gives me the data I need to teach my students. I can show them why certain cards see play, how the meta is shifting, and what to expect at their next Regional."

### For Content Creators

> "TrainerLab accelerates my research. Instead of spending hours gathering data for a video or article, I can pull insights and focus on the content."

### For Parents

> "TrainerLab helps me understand what my kid is into. I can see what decks are popular, what cards matter, and actually have informed conversations about their hobby."

## Brand Voice

| Attribute           | Description                | Example                                                                                        |
| ------------------- | -------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Knowledgeable**   | We've done the research    | "Japanese City Leagues show Charizard ex at 22% — here's why that matters for your Regionals." |
| **Helpful**         | Not gatekeeping, enabling  | "New to competitive? Start here."                                                              |
| **Data-driven**     | Show the receipts          | "Based on 847 tournament placements..."                                                        |
| **Forward-looking** | Always about what's coming | "Format forecast: What Japan tells us about post-rotation"                                     |
| **Respectful**      | Not elitist or dismissive  | Works for day-1 players and Worlds competitors                                                 |

**Voice in practice:**

- ✅ "Here's what the data shows"
- ✅ "Japan's BO1 format favors aggro — here's how to interpret that for your BO3 prep"
- ❌ "If you're not running this, you're throwing"
- ❌ "Casuals won't understand this"

## Visual Identity Direction

### Colors

| Color                             | Use              | Reasoning                                           |
| --------------------------------- | ---------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| **Deep blue**                     | Primary          | Trust, intelligence, research                       |
| **Bright accent** (teal or green) | Highlights, CTAs | Energy, discovery, Pokemon-adjacent without copying |
| **Clean white/light gray**        | Backgrounds      | Readability, modern feel                            |
| **Dark gray/charcoal**            | Text             | Professional                                        |

Avoid: Pokemon official red/yellow (legal), overly dark "gamer" aesthetics (excludes parents)

### Typography

- **Headings:** Clean sans-serif, slightly bold (Inter, Plus Jakarta Sans)
- **Body:** Highly readable (system fonts or similar)
- **Data:** Monospace accents for stats/numbers

### Visual Elements

- Clean data visualizations (not cluttered)
- Card images where relevant (proper attribution)
- Subtle lab/research motifs (grid patterns, subtle beakers/flasks in illustrations)
- **Potential mascot:** A Pokemon-professor-inspired character? Or keep it clean and professional.

## Feature Naming

Keeping with the lab theme:

| Feature          | Lab-Themed Name    | Alternative   |
| ---------------- | ------------------ | ------------- |
| Meta Dashboard   | **The Readout**    | Meta Lab      |
| Japanese Data    | **Field Research** | Japan Report  |
| Deck Builder     | **The Workbench**  | Deck Lab      |
| Card Search      | **The Index**      | Card Search   |
| Saved Decks      | **My Projects**    | My Decks      |
| Format Analysis  | **Lab Report**     | Format Report |
| New Set Analysis | **First Look**     | Set Preview   |

These are optional — could also just use straightforward names. But "Field Research" for Japan data is evocative.

## Elevator Pitch (Updated)

> "TrainerLab is a competitive intelligence platform for Pokemon TCG. We aggregate tournament data from around the world — including Japan, where they play new sets months before us — and turn it into actionable insights. Whether you're a player prepping for Regionals, a coach teaching students, a creator researching content, or a parent trying to understand the hobby, TrainerLab is where you do your homework."

---

## 30-Second Pitch

> "I'm building TrainerLab — a competitive research platform for Pokemon TCG.
>
> Right now, if you want to prep for a tournament, you're piecing together data from five different sites. Japanese results — which are basically a preview of your meta — are untranslated and lack context.
>
> TrainerLab puts it all in one place. Tournament data, Japanese insights with BO1 context, a deck builder with real inclusion rates, format analysis.
>
> It's not just for pro players — coaches use it to teach, creators use it to research, parents use it to understand what their kids are into.
>
> Think of it as the research lab for anyone serious about Pokemon TCG."
